# Product Management Portfolio

Hello! I'm an MBA candidate transitioning into product management, driven by a passion for solving complex user problems and building products that people love. This portfolio showcases my ability to think strategically, empathize with users, and apply data-driven insights to shape product direction.

My approach is grounded in a deep understanding of the user, a commitment to clear communication, and a focus on delivering measurable business impact.

## üöÄ Product Teardowns & Case Studies

Here you'll find detailed analyses of existing products. Each teardown is a deep dive into a specific user flow, identifying key friction points and proposing strategic redesigns to improve the user experience and achieve business goals.

### Product Teardown: Spotify's New User Onboarding
- **Focus**: A comprehensive analysis of Spotify's onboarding flow for new users.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Framework for Product Analysis

To ensure a structured and thorough analysis, I apply a consistent framework to every product teardown. This methodology allows me to move from high-level goals to specific, actionable recommendations.

1. **Define the Goal & Scope**  
   Identify a specific user flow and define a clear, measurable goal for the analysis.

2. **User and Market Analysis**  
   Develop user personas and apply the *Jobs to be Done (JTBD)* framework to understand user motivations and the competitive landscape.

3. **Deconstruct the User Journey**  
   Map the existing journey screen by screen to identify pain points, moments of delight, and potential drop-off risks.

4. **Prioritize Problems & Brainstorm Solutions**  
   Prioritize issues based on user impact and business goals, then brainstorm potential solutions for the most critical ones.

5. **Propose and Visualize the Redesign**  
   Articulate the proposed solution, create low-fidelity wireframes, and define success metrics to measure impact.
